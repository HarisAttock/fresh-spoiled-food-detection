# Fresh and Spoiled Food Detection – Mobile Application

## Description
This project is a mobile-based solution to detect whether food items are fresh or spoiled using machine learning.

The application supports the following food items:
Apple, Banana, Orange, Lemon, Cucumber, Tomato.

The frontend is built using React Native, while the backend is developed in Python using Flask.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React Native
- Backend: Python, Flask (REST API)
- Machine Learning: Image classification model
- Database & Services: Firebase

## How the System Works
1. User captures or uploads a food image using the mobile app.
2. The image is sent to the backend through Flask REST API.
3. The backend processes the image using a trained ML model.
4. The result (Fresh or Spoiled) is returned to the app in real time.

## Key Features
- Cross-platform mobile application (Android / iOS)
- Real-time food quality detection
- REST API integration
- Simple and user-friendly UI

## Project Note
Due to the large dataset size and model files, the complete ML backend is not publicly hosted.
This repository focuses on application structure and system design.

## Learning Outcomes
- React Native mobile app development
- Flask API integration
- Client-server architecture
- Practical ML integration in mobile apps
